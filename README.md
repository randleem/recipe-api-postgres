# Recipe Api Intro to PostgreSQL

*9th October 2020*
*Week 3 at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk)*

This was our third week Friday hackathon at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk) where we were first introduced to Node.js, express, databases, PostgreSQL and Heroku. 

Isabel Holland @hey-irh (my paired-programming partner for the week) were tasked with fixing code bugs and setting up and connecting our recipe display app to a heroku database with schemas created with PostgreSQL.

As a bonus task we created some styling for our App with CSS
